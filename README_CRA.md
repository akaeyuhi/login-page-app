In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run test` - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- `npm run eject` - exposes content of `react-script` package

- `npm run lint` - lints project files according to eslint rules, see below. Typical use case: continuous integration environments, Travis, CircleCI, etc.

- `npm run fix` - same as `npm run lint`, but also fixes errors, when possible. Typical use case: local development environment, git hooks.
